            <h2>Introduction</h2> 
            <p>Hello and welcome to my interactive CV. I am glad you found your way here!
            On this page you can find information about my education, work experience and me in general. 
            You can find the navigation bar on the left side of this page. You can use it to jump to different parts of my CV. 
            I have also linked my social media accounts to this page. Feel free to use them to contact me!
            </p>
            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently studying Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia. I am interested in software development and would
                like to make a career out of it!
            </p>
            <p>
                In my "previous" life I worked in the hospitality industry. I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality Management 
                from Tampere University of Applied Sciences. Working with people and creating experiences for customers was a lot of fun but when
                the Covid-19 pandemic hit and I got laid off from work I really started to think what I want to do with my life. I have always liked 
                problem solving and get along great with computers (as well as people) so here I am, studying my second degree!
            </p>
