        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia. I am interested in software development and would
            like to make a career out of it! <br><br>
            In my "previous" life I worked in the hospitality industry. I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Hospitality Management 
            from Tampere University of Applied Sciences. Working with people and creating experiences for customers was a lot of fun but when
            the Covid-19 pandemic hit and I got laid off from work I really started to think what I want to do with my life. I have always liked 
            problem solving and get along great with computers (as well as people) so here I am, studying my second degree!
